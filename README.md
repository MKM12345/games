# games
A collection of Games, choose as you wish.

These are full and completed games, you can copy them.


If you want to run the HTML codes, but not in a web browser, rather as a different window, you can use [Electron Fiddle](https://www.electronjs.org/fiddle) to do so.

I replicated this [code](https://github.com/MKM12345/games/blob/main/CollectionOfgames/tictactoe2.py) on my own
