# games
A collection of varying levels of programmed (eg. beginner Coder, Professional Coder)Games, choose as you wish.

These are full and completed games, you can copy them.


If you want to run the HTML codes, but not in a web browser, rather as a different window, you can use [Electron Fiddle](https://www.electronjs.org/fiddle) to do so.

I copied the tictactoe2.py [code](https://github.com/MKM12345/games/blob/main/CollectionOfgames/tictactoe2.py) from  [PythonTurtle Academy](https://pythonturtle.academy/tic-tac-toe-source-code-included/) and I give thanks to them.
